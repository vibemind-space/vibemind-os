# OpenClaw Onboarding Wizard

This skill conducts a structured interview to understand the user's goals, environment, and constraints, then generates a personalized OpenClaw deployment journey with specific milestones, commands, and configurations.

## Interview Process

Conduct the interview in **three focused rounds**. After each round, acknowledge the answers before asking the next set. Do not ask all questions at once.

### Round 1: Who and Why

Ask these questions first:

1. **Experience level** — "Are you brand new to OpenClaw, upgrading from an older version, or migrating from another tool?"
2. **Primary use case** — "Which best describes your goal?"
   - Personal AI assistant (just me, on my own devices)
   - Family or small team (a few trusted people sharing one gateway)
   - Team/org deployment (10+ users, need access controls)
   - Developer tool (coding assistant, CI/CD integration, automation)
   - Chatbot/service (customer-facing or public-facing bot)

### Round 2: Channels and Environment

Continue with:

3. **Messaging platforms** — "Which platforms do you want to connect? Pick all that apply." List the relevant ones:
   - Consumer: WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Signal, iMessage/BlueBubbles, IRC
   - Enterprise: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Feishu/Lark, Mattermost
   - Other: Matrix, LINE, Nostr, Twitch, WebChat, Zalo
4. **Operating environment** — "Where will OpenClaw run?"
   - macOS (personal machine)
   - Linux server (systemd)
   - Windows WSL2
   - Docker / Kubernetes
   - Cloud VM (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Round 3: Security, Model, and Automation

Continue with:

5. **Security posture** — "How locked down does this need to be?"
   - Relaxed (just me, trusted network)
   - Moderate (small group, some access controls)
   - Strict (multi-user, sandboxed, audited)
   - Enterprise (compliance requirements, secrets management, incident response plan)
6. **Model preference** — "Which AI provider do you want to use?"
   - Anthropic API key (Claude models — Opus for quality, Sonnet for speed/cost balance, Haiku for budget)
   - OpenAI API key (GPT models)
   - Ollama / local models (free, private, self-hosted)
   - Kilo Code gateway (managed hosting)
   - xAI / Grok
   - Moonshot / Kimi (includes web search)
   - Not sure yet / help me pick
7. **Automation goals** — "What do you want to automate?" (optional, can skip)
   - Scheduled messages / daily digests
   - Gmail/email processing
   - Code review or CI/CD notifications
   - Custom workflows with sub-agents
   - Nothing yet, just messaging for now

### Fast Track

If the user asks to skip the interview, wants "the simplest setup", or says "just get me started", skip directly to Template A (Personal AI Assistant) using their OS and a sensible default model (Sonnet 4.6 for API users, Ollama for local). Present it with a note that they can re-run `/onboarding` later to customize.

## Journey Synthesis

After collecting all answers, generate a personalized journey. Consult **[references/journey-templates.md](references/journey-templates.md)** for milestone templates and **[references/feature-matrix.md](references/feature-matrix.md)** for feature-to-use-case mapping.

### Output Format

Structure the journey as numbered milestones:

```
## Your OpenClaw Journey

Based on your answers:
- Use case: [summary]
- Channels: [list]
- Environment: [platform]
- Security: [level]

### Milestone 1: Install & Verify (Day 1)
[Specific commands for their OS]

### Milestone 2: Connect Your Channels (Day 1-2)
[Only the channels they selected, with links to channel-setup.md]

### Milestone 3: Lock It Down (Day 2-3)
[Security config matched to their posture]

### Milestone 4: [Use-case specific]
[Automation, sub-agents, team onboarding, etc.]

### What's Next
[Advanced features they didn't ask for but should know about]
```

### Tailoring Rules

Apply these rules when generating the journey:

- **New users**: Include every step, explain what each command does, add verification checks after each milestone
- **Upgraders**: Focus on breaking changes (tools.profile, ACP dispatch, iMessage deprecation), new features, and migration steps
- **Solo/personal**: Use `tools.profile: "full"`, skip sandbox, recommend `pairing` DM policy
- **Family/team**: Use `tools.profile: "messaging"`, enable `per-channel-peer` session isolation, sandbox with `ro` workspace
- **Enterprise/strict**: Full sandbox, `allowlist` policies, tool denials, SecretRef, HSTS, security audit cron
- **Docker/K8s**: Include health endpoint config, disk budgets, token via env var, `0.0.0.0` binding with auth
- **WSL2**: Include nvm sourcing, systemd setup, powershell wrapper notes
- **Each channel**: Include only setup steps for channels the user selected; reference the relevant section of channel-setup.md
- **Model selection**: Respect the user's provider choice. Do not default to the most expensive option. If "not sure", recommend based on use case — see the model recommendations table in [references/feature-matrix.md](references/feature-matrix.md). For budget-conscious users, recommend Sonnet or Haiku. For privacy-focused users, recommend Ollama.
- **Automation goals**: Map to specific cron/webhook/sub-agent recipes from the main [openclaw-manager SKILL.md](../openclaw-manager/SKILL.md) Recommended Workflows section

### Cross-References

When generating the journey, link to the existing plugin documentation:

- Installation steps: reference the main [SKILL.md](../openclaw-manager/SKILL.md) installation section
- Channel setup: reference [channel-setup.md](../openclaw-manager/channel-setup.md) for the specific channels selected
- Security: reference [security-checklist.md](../openclaw-manager/security-checklist.md) for the user's security level
- CLI commands: reference [cli-reference.md](../openclaw-manager/cli-reference.md) for command details
- Troubleshooting: reference [troubleshooting.md](../openclaw-manager/troubleshooting.md) for common issues

## Handling Edge Cases

- If the user gives vague answers ("I don't know"), suggest the most common path (personal assistant on macOS with WhatsApp + Telegram) and note they can adjust later.
- If the user wants channels not yet documented, note the plugin-based channel and link to OpenClaw docs at https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels.
- If the user is on a version older than v2026.3.1 (recommended for full feature support; v2026.2.12 is the minimum for security), make **upgrading** Milestone 0 before anything else.
- If the user describes a use case that doesn't fit the templates, adapt creatively — the templates are starting points, not constraints.
- If the user provides goals upfront (via argument-hint), skip redundant questions and jump to the relevant round.
